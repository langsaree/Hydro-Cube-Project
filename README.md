# Hydro Cube Project

## Implementing NodeMCU IoT for Smart Hydroponic Cube Using LED Growing Light

this study aimed to propose smart hydroponic cube. It is a household hydroponic farm using LED growing lights, LDR sensor, water level sensor, water pump temperature, spray pump as an automatic growing system. The reason of making this project is to believe if everyone can grow their own food, and they would have fresher and healthier food with limited space. That is the reasons why created smart hydroponic cube. It can control and automate all functions in everywhere via Blynk and ESP32 by using smart phone. However, this system can be the answer for who have no time and have no much place to plant hydroponic. Therefore, this is one choice to plant your vegetable at home by yourself by did not take care every time.
